    "# The Python Programming Language¶\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example of a high-level language; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C++, PHP, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. Machine language is the encoding of instructions in binary so that they can be directly executed by the computer. Assembly language uses a slightly easier format to refer to the low level instructions. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages. To be exact, computers can actually only execute programs written in machine language. Thus, programs written in a high-level language (and even those in assembly language) have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters and compilers. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/_images/interpret.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the source code, and the translated program is called the object code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation. \t\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/_images/compile.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many modern languages use both processes. They are first compiled into a lower level language, called byte code, and then interpreted by a program called a virtual machine. Python uses both processes, but because of the way programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to use the Python interpreter: shell mode and program mode. In shell mode, you type Python expressions into the Python shell, and the interpreter immediately shows the result. The example below shows the Python shell at work.\n",

    "\n",
    "Working directly in the interpreter is convenient for testing short bits of code because you get immediate feedback. Think of it as scratch paper used to help you work out problems.\n"

    "## How to be a Successful Programmer\n",
    "One of the most important skills you need to aquire to complete this book successfully is the ability to debug your programs. Debugging might be the most under-appreciated, and under-taught, skill in introductory computer science. For that reason we are introducing a series of “debugging interludes.” Debugging is a skill that you need to master over time, and some of the tips and tricks are specific to different aspects of Python programming. So look for additional debugging interludes throughout the rest of this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is an odd thing in a way. Here is why. As programmers we spend 99% of our time trying to get our program to work. We struggle, we stress, we spend hours deep in frustration trying to get our program to execute correctly. Then when we do get it going we celebrate, hand it in, and move on to the next homework assignment or programming task. But here is the secret, when you are successful, you are happy, your brain releases a bit of chemical that makes you feel good. You need to organize your programming so that you have lots of little successess. It turns out your brain doesn’t care all that much if you have successfully written hello world, or a fast fourier transform (trust me its hard) you still get that little release that makes you happy. When you are happy you want to go on and solve the next little problem. Essentially I’m telling you once again, start small, get something small working, and then add to it."

    "## How to Avoid Debugging\n",
    "Perhaps the most important lesson in debugging is that it is largely avoidable – if you work carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start Small This is probably the single biggest piece of advice for programmers at every level. Of course its tempting to sit down and crank out an entire program at once. But, when the program – inevitably – does not work then you have a myriad of options for things that might be wrong. Where to start? Where to look first? How to figure out what went wrong? I’ll get to that in the next section. So, start with something really small. Maybe just two lines and then make sure that runs ok. Hitting the run button is quick and easy, and gives you immediate feedback about whether what you have just done is ok or not. Another immediate benefit of having something small working is that you have something to turn in. Turning in a small, incomplete program, is almost always better than nothing.\n",
    "Keep it working Once you have a small part of your program working the next step is to figure out something small to add to it. If you keep adding small pieces of the program one at a time, it is much easier to figure out what went wrong, as it is most likely that the problem is going to be in the new code you have just added. Less new code means its easier to figure out where the problem is.\n",
    "This notion of Get something working and keep it working is a mantra that you can repeat throughout your career as a programmer. It’s a great way to avoid the frustrations mentioned above. Think of it this way. Every time you have a little success, your brain releases a tiny bit of chemical that makes you happy. So, you can keep yourself happy and make programming more enjoyable by creating lots of small victories for yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, let’s look at an example. Let’s solve the problem posed in question 3 at the end of the Simple Python Data chapter. Ask the user for the time now (in hours 0 - 23), and ask for the number of hours to wait. Your program should output what the time will be on the clock when the alarm goes off.\n",

This illustrates an important aspect of testing, which is that it is important to test your code on a range of inputs. It is especially important to test your code on boundary conditions. In this case you would want to test your program for hours including 0, 23, and some in between. You would want to test your wait times for 0, and some really large numbers.

That is you have commented out the creation of the name current_time_str. So of course when you want to convert it to an int you will get the NameError.

It’s also important to keep calm, and evaluate each new clue carefully so you don’t waste time chasing problems that are not really there.\n",

So maybe you move the print statement to be after line 2 and again after 3. Line 3 is where you expect the value of x to be changed to an integer. Could line 4 be mysteriously changine x back to a string? Not very likely. So the value and type of x is just what you would expect it to be after line 2, but not after line 3.

    "Finding Clues With name errors one of the best things you can do is use the editor, or browser search function. Quite often if you search for the exact word in the error message one of two things will happen:\n",

    "1) The word you are searching for will appear only once in your code, its also likely that it will be on the right hand side of an assignment statment, or as a parameter to a function. That should confirm for you that you have a typo somewhere. If the name in question is what you thought it should be then you probably have a typo on the left hand side of an assignment statement on a line before your error message occurs. Start looking backward at your assignment statements. In some cases its really nice to leave all the highlighted strings from the search function visible as they will help you very quickly find a line where you might have expected your variable to be highlighted.\n",

    "In Python, a function is a named sequence of statements that belong together. Their primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the solution to the problem.\n",

    "The syntax for a function definition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "def name( parameters ):\n",
    "    statements</pre>\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can make up any names you want for the functions you create, except that you can’t use a name that is a Python keyword, and the names must follow the rules for legal identifiers that were given previously. The parameters specify what information, if any, you have to provide in order to use the new function. Another way to say this is that the parameters specify what the function needs to do its work.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be indented from the def. In the examples in this book, we will use the standard indentation of four spaces. Function definitions are the second of several compound statements we will see, all of which have the same pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "A header line which begins with a keyword and ends with a colon.\n",
    "A body consisting of one or more Python statements, each indented the same amount – 4 spaces is the Python standard – from the header line.\n",
    "We’ve already seen the for loop which follows this pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a function definition, the keyword in the header is def, which is followed by the name of the function and some parameters enclosed in parentheses. The parameter list may be empty, or it may contain any number of parameters separated from one another by commas. In either case, the parentheses are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to say a bit more about the parameters. In the definition, the parameter list is more specifically known as the formal parameters. This list of names describes those things that the function will need to receive from the user of the function. When you use a function, you provide values to the formal parameters.\n",

We’ve already seen how to call some built-in functions like print, range and int. Function calls contain the name of the function to be executed followed by a list of values, called arguments, which are assigned to the parameters in the function definition.

First, Python looks at the variables that are defined as local variables in the function. We call this the local scope. If the variable name is not found in the local scope, then Python looks at the global variables, or global scope. This is exactly the case illustrated in the code above. power is not found locally in badsquare but it does exist globally. The appropriate way to write this function would be to pass power as a parameter. For practice, you should rewrite the badsquare example to have a second parameter called power.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another variation on this theme of local versus global variables. Assignment statements in the local function cannot change variables defined outside the function. Consider the following codelens example:"

    "\n",
    "The value of power in the local scope was different than the global scope. That is because in this example power was used on the left hand side of the assignment statement power = p. When a variable name is used on the left hand side of an assignment statement Python creates a local variable. When a local variable has the same name as a global variable we say that the local shadows the global. A shadow means that the global variable cannot be accessed by Python because the local variable will be found first. This is another good reason not to use global variables. As you can see, it makes your code confusing and difficult to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "To cement all of these ideas even further lets look at one final example. Inside the square function we are going to make an assignment to the parameter x There’s no good reason to do this other than to emphasize the fact that the parameter x is a local variable. If you step through the example in codelens you will see that although x is 0 in the local variables for square, the x in the global scope remains 2. This is confusing to many beginning programmers who think that an assignment to a formal parameter will cause a change to the value of the variable that was used as the actual parameter, especially when the two share the same name. But this example demonstrates that that is clearly not how Python operates."
